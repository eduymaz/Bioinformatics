SCATS | A statistical tool to detect differential alternative splicing events using single-cell RNA-seq


SCATS (Statistical tool for identifying differential alternative splicing events using single-cell RNA-seq data) is a bioinformatics tool designed to 
detect differential alternative splicing (DAS) events at the single-cell level. By leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, 
SCATS addresses the challenge of capturing the heterogeneity of alternative splicing across individual cells, which is often masked in bulk RNA-seq analyses. 
The tool employs a hierarchical model to quantify exon-inclusion levels and utilizes a likelihood ratio test to identify statistically significant DAS events. 
This approach allows researchers to explore the dynamic landscape of alternative splicing with high resolution, providing insights into cellular diversity and 
gene regulation mechanisms. SCATS is particularly useful for studies focused on developmental biology, cancer, 
and other areas where cell-specific alternative splicing plays a crucial role.
