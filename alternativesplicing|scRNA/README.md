# SingleCellRNAseq-AlternativeSplicing-

Background/Aim

During the early stages of human embryo, the chromatin was subject to an uncanny orchestration leading to fast-paced changes on gene expression patterns. Even though we now have robust knowledge on the expression levels of genes during preimplantation, how alternative splicing (AS) events lead to different transcript isoforms at this stage remains largely unexplored.

Materials and Methods

In this study, we analysed exon inclusion/exclusion events at single-cell level using a previously published dataset (GSE71318). We analysed at least three independent cells from oocyte, zygote, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, early blastocyst, middle blastocyst and late blastocyst embryos as well as ICM and TE stages. We checked common alternative splicing events that only occur for each stage by employing the SCATS bioinformatics approach. Read counts for each exon were fitted onto a hierarchical model, and the differential exon inclusion levels between different cell groups were evaluated using a maximum likelihood ratio test.

Results

We demonstrated that there are stage-specific and distinctive AS events throughout human preimplantation. Highest number of stage-specific AS events was detected for the zygote stage (2506 events) followed by 2-cell (1908 events) and oocyte (1710 events) and 4-cell stages (1624 events). Genes related to histone modification, methylation and chromosome organization were consistently enriched for each phase. RNA processing genes were particularly enriched for every stage from 2-cell stage to morula. Intriguingly, genes such as AMD1 (SAM metabolism), ARMC8 (cytoskeleton organization), ATP6V1C2 (ATPase), TDP1 (DNA Repair), THOC2 (RNA transport), UBAP2L (ubiquitin-proteasome system) exhibited a distinct AS event for every particular preimplantation phase.

Conclusion

Highlighting the zygotic stage as the most AS-driven phase, the comprehensive list we are providing here involves many crucial genes related to chromatin regulation and RNA processing. Understanding the functional roles of these AS events in future could provide invaluable insights that can be harnessed for developmental biology and regenerative medicine.
